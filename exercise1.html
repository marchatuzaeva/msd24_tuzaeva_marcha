<h1 id="calculator">Calculator</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to calculate numbers that are given by
the user. The user is asked for a <strong>first number</strong> and then
a <strong>second number</strong>. Both of these numbers are saved as an
integer [variable] (https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_variables.asp)
<em>(n1 and n2)</em>. After that the user is asked about an
<strong>operator</strong> <em>(+, -, *, /)</em> that the numbers should
be calculated by. This operator is saved as a <strong>string</strong>
called <em>operator</em>.</p>
<h3 id="if-statements">If-statements</h3>
<p>The if-statements that are implemented in the source code, make sure
that the numbers given by the user are calculated correctly.</p>
<p>If there is no valid input by the user for the operator, the
following will be printed: &gt; invalid operator, please try again</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>To execute this source code, it will be necessary to download the
programming language <strong>“Java”</strong>. Furthermore, an editor
will be necessary such as <strong>“IntelliJ”</strong> or
<strong>“VisualStudioCode”</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="instruction-for-the-usage">Instruction for the usage</h2>
<p>After opening the source code in an editor, configure the source code
by typing into the shell: “javac Calculator.java”. Check for error
warnings. If there are no error warning continue with “java Calculator”.
There shouldn’t be any warnings and the following text will shop up &gt;
First number:</p>
<p>Here you should type in your first number that you want to use for
the calculation. Then press enter and the next line will show up: &gt;
Second number:</p>
<p>After pressing enter again, you will be asked for an operator: &gt;
Operator:</p>
<p>There you have to enter an operator like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>+</li>
<li>-</li>
<li>*</li>
<li>/</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>First number: 2 Second number: 3 Operator: + 2 + 3 = 5</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="contribution">Contribution</h2>
<p>Instead of using a scanner for this source code, you could also
provide the integers and the operator as command line arguments (String
[args]) in form of <n1> <operator> <n2>.</p>
