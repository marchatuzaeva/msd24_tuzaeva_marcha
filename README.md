# Calculator

## Description
The purpose of this project is to calculate numbers that are given by the user. The user is asked for a **first number** and then a **second number**. Both of these numbers are saved as an integer [variable] (https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_variables.asp) *(n1 and n2)*. After that the user is asked about an **operator** *(+, -, \*, /)* that the numbers should be calculated by. This operator is saved as a **string** called *operator*.

### If-statements
The if-statements that are implemented in the source code, make sure that the numbers given by the user are calculated correctly.

If there is no valid input by the user for the operator, the following will be printed:
> invalid operator, please try again

## Installation
To execute this source code, it will be necessary to download the programming language **"Java"**. Furthermore, an editor will be necessary such as **"IntelliJ"** or **"VisualStudioCode"**.

## Instruction for the usage
After opening the source code in an editor, configure the source code by typing into the shell: "javac Calculator.java". Check for error warnings. If there are no error warning continue with "java Calculator". There shouldn't be any warnings and the following text will shop up
> First number:

Here you should type in your first number that you want to use for the calculation. Then press enter and the next line will show up:
> Second number:

After pressing enter again, you will be asked for an operator:
> Operator:

There you have to enter an operator like the following:

* \+
* \-
* \*
* /

### Example
>First number: 2
Second number: 3
Operator:      +
2 + 3 = 5

## Contribution
Instead of using a scanner for this source code, you could also provide the integers and the operator as command line arguments (String [args]) in form of <n1> <operator> <n2>.

# List of exercises
[Exercise 1 - Creating and converting markdown files](exercise1.md)
Exercise 1 focuses on creating two markdown files. One is called "README", which describes a calculator and the other file is called "exercise1", which is converted into pdf and html.
[Exercise 2 - Git Commands](exercise2.md)
Exercise 2 focuses on learning and documenting key Git commands, understanding their functionality, and practicing using Git workflows.
[Exercise 3 - Maven-based Java project](exercise3.md)
Exercise 3 focuses on creating and structuring a Maven-based Java project, implementing calculator functionalities, and documenting the process using Git version control.
