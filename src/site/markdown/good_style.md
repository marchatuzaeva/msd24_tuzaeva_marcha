## Effective Source Code Comments
- **Be precise**: Comments should clarify what the code accomplishes rather than simply explaining how it works.
- **Explain intent**: Provide reasoning behind complex logic or unique implementations.
- **Keep comments relevant**: Ensure comments remain up to date as the code evolves.
- **Avoid redundancy**: Don't state the obvious—focus on insights that enhance understanding.
- **Highlight edge cases**: Document any special conditions, known issues, or unconventional approaches.

## Best Practices for Git Commit Messages
- **Use clear, action-driven statements**: Write concise commit titles in imperative form (e.g., `"Refactor error handling"`).
- **Separate title from details**: Keep the commit summary distinct from further explanations.
- **Provide context when needed**: If the commit introduces a major change, explain the reasoning behind it.
- **Make commits focused**: Each commit should address a single logical update rather than bundling multiple unrelated changes.
- **Avoid vague messages**: Skip generic descriptions like `"Updated"` or `"Bug fixes"`—be specific!
